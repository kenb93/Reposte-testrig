# Reposte — Public Test Rig (Messaging A/B)

This repository hosts a small **public landing-page test rig** used to evaluate how people respond to different descriptions of an early prototype.

## What this is
- Two simple landing pages that describe the same idea using different framing (A/B).
- Each page has a call-to-action that (for invited testers) links to a private, early-stage **Strategy Validator** prototype.

## What the Strategy Validator does (high-level)
The Strategy Validator is a structured questionnaire designed to help a person:
- surface assumptions
- clarify goals/constraints
- identify unknowns
- decide what evidence would reduce uncertainty

It’s intended to support **evidence-led decision making** rather than “vibes-based” planning.

## How to use this repo
### 1) Visit the pages
- Variant A: `./a/`
- Variant B: `./b/`

### 2) Compare the framing
Read both pages and see which one makes the value clearer to you.

### 3) Try the prototype (invited testers only)
The call-to-action from the landing page leads to a private test environment.

If you’ve been invited, use the CTA button.
If you haven’t, you can still:
- read the two variants
- share feedback on which framing is clearer and why

## Feedback requested
If you’re giving feedback, please include:
- which variant you preferred (A or B)
- what you think the system is (in your own words)
- what problem you believe it solves
- what would make you trust it enough to try it

## Notes
- This is an early prototype.
- The purpose of this repo is **messaging validation**, not product documentation.
- No internal implementation details are published here.
