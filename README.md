# Reposte — Public Test Rig (Messaging A/B)

This repository hosts a small **public landing-page test rig** used to validate messaging for an early prototype.

## What problem is this for?

Research and experience both suggest that many business failures come from **decisions built on untested assumptions**. One widely-cited claim is that *a very large majority* of failures trace back to assumptions that were never validated early enough.

This project is an attempt to help people find **evidence** that can underpin those choices — so actions are based on *verifiable facts* rather than belief and hope.

If you’re building a small business or project, it’s easy to waste weeks on:
- unclear goals and hidden constraints
- untested assumptions (“people will want this…”) 
- plans that aren’t tied to evidence

This test rig exists to help find the clearest explanation of a prototype designed to support **evidence‑led decisions**.

## What this repo contains
- **Variant A** and **Variant B** landing pages (two different framings of the same idea)
- a lightweight call-to-action (CTA) for invited testers

Pages:
- Variant A: `./a/`
- Variant B: `./b/`

## What the Strategy Validator does (high-level)
The Strategy Validator is a structured questionnaire designed to help a person:
- surface assumptions
- clarify goals/constraints
- identify unknowns
- decide what evidence would reduce uncertainty

It’s intended to support **decision clarity** before time/money is committed.

## How to use
1) Read both variants.
2) Decide which one makes the value clearer.
3) If you’re invited, use the CTA and try the prototype.

## How to give feedback (requested)
Please include:
- which variant you preferred (**A** or **B**)
- what you think the system is (in your own words)
- what problem you believe it solves
- what would make you trust it enough to try it

### Where to send feedback
- Open a GitHub issue in this repo (recommended): **Issues → New issue**

## Notes
- This is an early prototype.
- The purpose of this repo is **messaging validation**, not product documentation.
- No internal implementation details or private access details are published here.
